Wealthfront

* When was the company incorporated?
December 2011

* Who are the founders of the company?
Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Andy Rachleff, a venture capitalist, and Dan Carroll, a financial advisor, identified a gap in the market for automated, low-cost investment services. They were like, "Hey, why can't we make financial advice more democratic and less of a rich man's game?" Andy, who was already a big shot from his VC firm Benchmark Capital, was teaching at Stanford and realized that even the brightest minds there couldn't access the financial tools they needed. Dan, on the other hand, was a former trader who got woke to the financial crisis of 2008 and was like, "Nah, this can't go on." Long story short, they teamed up, secured a cool $200 million in funding, and boom—Wealthfront was born.

Blockchain technology for cryptocurrency management and advanced analytics for ESG portfolio optimization.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Blockchain ensures secure and transparent cryptocurrency transactions, while advanced analytics can help in the meticulous design of ESG portfolios.
